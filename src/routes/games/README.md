## Adding Featured Game
Add the following to `data.ts`:
1. Game Header Image (image link)
2. Game Title (string)
3. Contributors (array of strings)
4. Short description (string)
5. Link to a page to download your game (link)
You can reference the already existing game data in `data.ts` if still a bit lost.
