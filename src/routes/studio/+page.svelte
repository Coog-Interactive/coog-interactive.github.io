        <h1>OUR STUDIO</h1>
        <p>
            Founded by a passionate mix of industry professionals, academics, and student developers, Coog Interactive's studio provides students with something most programs seldomly offer: a true to life, studio-style production experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            You won’t just hastily develop a game for a class assignment or hobby project—you’ll work in a structured pipeline, collaborate across disciplines with agile teams of like-minded individuals, and be provided the support to ship a playable title of professional quality by the end of each semester.
